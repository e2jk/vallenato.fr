# .github/scripts/auto-rebase-stale-bot-prs.sh
#
# Finds open Dependabot/Renovate PRs against master that have fallen behind
# (or hit a conflict) and asks each bot to rebase, via its own
# API-friendly path (see .github/workflows/auto-rebase-stale-bot-prs.yml
# for the full "why" — a ruleset's strict required-status-checks policy
# means any PR merge makes every other open PR stale at once).
#
# Every PR this script looks at is logged — number, author login, and
# mergeStateStatus, plus whether it matched a known bot login and whether
# it counted as stale — even the ones skipped. A naive version could filter
# non-matching/non-stale PRs out of a jq pipeline before anything was ever
# logged, so if gh CLI ever starts reporting bot authors as
# "app/renovate"/"app/dependabot" instead of the classic
# "renovate[bot]"/"dependabot[bot]" (gh CLI >=2.98 does this), a workflow
# built that way would silently match nothing on every run — no error, no
# output, just quiet inaction. This script exists so that failure mode is
# visible instead of silent.
#
# Requires GH_TOKEN and GH_REPO in the environment, same as any other gh
# CLI invocation — safe to run locally with a personal token to debug.
#
# A PR labelled `no-auto-rebase` is skipped entirely, regardless of
# mergeStateStatus or attempt count. Use this for a bot PR that's stale for
# a known, non-staleness reason -- e.g. a dependency bump that conflicts
# with another package's pin until *that* package releases a compatible
# version. Rebasing such a PR every 6h just burns its 3 attempts without
# ever fixing the actual problem, and then it goes silent (see
# MAX_ATTEMPTS below) instead of surfacing that it's blocked on something
# external. Add the label by hand once the reason is understood; remove it
# once the blocking condition is resolved so normal auto-rebase resumes.
#
# Env vars (all optional, defaults match the workflow):
#   MAX_ATTEMPTS  max rebase nudges per PR before leaving it for a human (default 3)
#   MARKER        HTML comment used to count this script's own past comments
